	</h1>
	<font face="New Times Roman " color="black" size="3">
		I'm a senior in high school. All my life i have lived in new york. Im also the oldest of 3 siblings so im always helping out all most of the responsibilities fall onto me. 
		So as the oldest im always seeking to do my best set an example for my siblings not only that but I also wanna give them a better life I want to help to provide a better opportunity for all of my siblings.
		The two sports I enjoy playing is volleybal and badminton. During my junoir year I was team captian for badminton I think that was one of the best experiences in high school.
		I share my knowledge of these sports with my siblings hoping they like this sport or just to create a better bond with them as well to create memories with them.
		Being the oldest and being first generation to going to college would be the biggest complishment i have done so far. Me doing all of this to set this example to my sisters that anything is possible when you do your best.
